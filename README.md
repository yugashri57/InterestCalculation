Interest Calculation:
This is a Java console-based Bank RD (Recurring Deposit) Calculator.
        It calculates interest, total deposited amount, and maturity amount based on principal, tenure, age, and gender.
        The project uses OOP concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and custom exceptions.
        Input validation ensures correct data entry, otherwise a BankValidationException is thrown.
        It supports tenures of 5 or 10 years with different interest rates for male and female customers.
A simple yet effective project to demonstrate Java exception handling and financial calculations.
